This is the RPbufr package.  It contains a perl module for reading
and writing BUFR files, especially BUFR files containing ground-based GPS data
or space-based radio occultation (RO) data.

BUFR is a WMO standard for encoding weather observations compactly.  It is
a non-byte aligned, table-driven standard which weather centers use for
data to be ingested into weather models.  The BUFR format for radio 
occultation data has been approved by the WMO, as has the BUFR format
for ground-based GPS/GNSS data.

This package requires a somewhat recent perl (say >= perl 5.10) and the PDL
(perl data language) module.

The PDL module has several dependencies, for latest installation instructions, see

http://pdl.perl.org/?page=install

Once PDL is installed, then install this module like so:

tar -xvzf RObufr-V.VV.tar.gz
cd RObufr-V.VV
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test # should show all OK
make install

Then you should be able to decode a CDAAC BUFR file (and maybe some other sorts too) like so:

dump_bufr.pl BUFR_file_name

Sample BUFR files are in the ./t directory:

RO BUFR:
bfrPrf_MTPA.2012.001.00.03.G27_2011.2980_bufr.good

Ground-base GPS:
ucarPw_2012.249.04.15.0030.01_bufr

Good luck!
